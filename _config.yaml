# Education section
education:
  item1:
    institution: Polytechnic University of the Philippines
    program: Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering
    description: >
      Computer Engineering is a four-year degree program that deals with the study of computer systems. 
      The curriculum covers both software and hardware and develops the student's ability to analyze computer systems, designs, 
      construction of electronic equipment and its peripherals. Since computer science is directed to the theory and technology of computation,
      the curriculum does not specialize along traditional lines that divide hardware and software, systems and applications, or theory and experiment.
      Rather, a unified approach to the design and analysis of computers and of computing structures is employed. 
      This background prepares the student for placements as computer engineers in government industry. 
      It also qualifies them for related job with computer manufacturers and consulting firms as systems programmers as well
      as application programmers with scientific, research, and business organizations. 
      The ethical considerations with respect to the profession is an important component of the program of study.
